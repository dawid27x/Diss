# AI Customisation Tool

## Overview
The **AI Customisation Tool** is a web application that empowers users to create and configure their own AI models without requiring coding knowledge.  
Developed as part of a dissertation project at the University of Manchester, the tool focuses on **democratising AI model creation** by making AI accessible, customisable, and educational for all users.

## Features

- **Live Prompt Preview** – Real-time updates as users customise their AI model's behaviour.
- **UI Customisation** – Choose background colours, text colours, and upload a logo.
- **Advanced Settings** – Adjust parameters such as temperature, presence penalty, and frequency penalty with instant behavioural summaries.
- **Educational Tooltips** – Understand how each setting affects the AI model's responses.
- **Accessible Design** – Built for ease of use, aimed at users of all experience levels.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS
- **Hosting:** (e.g., AWS, Vercel)
- **APIs:** (e.g., OpenAI API)

## Motivation

This tool addresses the increasing monopolisation of AI by large corporations by providing an accessible, free alternative. It is designed to bridge the knowledge gap and empower individuals to build, understand, and trust their own AI systems.
