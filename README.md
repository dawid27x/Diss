# AI Customisation Tool

## Overview
The **AI Customisation Tool** is a web application that empowers users to create and configure their own AI models without requiring coding knowledge.  
Developed as part of a dissertation project at the University of Leeds, the tool focuses on **democratising AI model creation** by making AI accessible, customisable, and educational for all users.

## Features

- **Live Prompt Preview** – Real-time updates as users customise their AI model's behaviour.
- **UI Customisation** – Choose background colours, text colours, logo and create custom buttons.
- **Advanced Settings** – Adjust parameters such as temperature, presence penalty, and frequency penalty with instant behavioural summaries.
- **Educational Tooltips** – Understand how each setting affects the AI model's responses.
- **Accessible Design** – Built for ease of use, aimed at users of all experience levels.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Javascript, NodeJS

## Motivation

This tool addresses the increasing monopolisation of AI by large corporations by providing an accessible, free alternative to allow users to interact with AI in a more meaningful way. It is designed to bridge the knowledge gap and empower individuals to build, understand, and trust their own AI systems.

## Future Improvements
Add preset templates for different use cases (e.g., creative writing AI, business assistant AI).

Include model configuration saving and loading.

Support for additional advanced parameters.
