***AI Customisation Tool***

**Overview**
The AI Customisation Tool is a web application that empowers users to create and configure their own AI models without requiring coding knowledge.
Originally developed as part of a dissertation project at the University of Manchester, the tool focuses on democratising AI model creation by making AI accessible, customisable, and educational for all users.

**Features**
Live Prompt Preview – See real-time updates as you customise your AI model's behaviour.

UI Customisation – Choose background colours, text colours, and upload your own logo.

Advanced Settings – Adjust temperature, presence penalty, and frequency penalty with instant behavioural summaries.

Educational Tooltips – Understand how each setting affects your AI model.

Accessible Design – Built for ease of use, aimed at users of all experience levels.
